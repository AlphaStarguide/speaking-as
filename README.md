# Speaking As
Displays the character you are speaking as. You can right click the text to bring up a character selection screen to talk as. You can also lock yourself to speak out of character.

Majority of the functionality is attributed to [Illandril's Chat Enhancements](https://github.com/illandril/FoundryVTT-chat-enhancements) and [Cautious Gamemaster's Pack](https://github.com/cs96and/FoundryVTT-CGMP), but with large changes to formatting.
